# Middleman-ML-Lab

This repository includes my project completed when learning machine learning (ML).

## About the projects

Each folder represents an individual project that I think is important for a beginner in ML.

If you want to see the turtorial for a project please check the README in each folder - there will be a link to by introductory blog post.

**Updated projects:**
- [MNIST handwritten digit classification (from scratch)](./MNIST/)

More projects will be added soon!

Here is my personal blog where I record mY life, my research and my hobbies etc. 
It's only written in Chinese, but there is a button on the right side of the navigation bar that allows you to switch the language (automaticly translated by Google LOL).
